We will be able to list which students can attend a course that is moved to a new room and/or time.

	(loop) is student free
	is instructor free
	is room big enough
	is room free

We will develop a formula that will quantify how well a move of a course works with the enrolled students' schedules.

	total weight = 4 * seniors_can - 4 * seniors_cant + ... freshman_can - freshman_cant
