We will make sure our tool works with the second official CSV.

We will integrate the CSV's of the seats in MBB IF all have been completed.

We will ensure that our tool will run on Dr. Reeves' laptop, and on any unix machine with the proper software installed.

We will format the output on the command line tool (outside of cucumber), specifically for the banners and their classifications

We will catch up with commenting our code.

We will document in the code the complexity of our methods.

Stretch goals but not commitments:
	Integrate javadocs with current documentation
	Write the paragraph about which complexity is better for us
