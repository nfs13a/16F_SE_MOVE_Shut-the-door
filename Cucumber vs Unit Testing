Both unit testing and test-driven development involve writing automated tests to be run whenever the pertaining piece of software is updated. Unit testing is performed when a bug is discovered. The tests are written to isolate the bug, i.e. the tests should be written to produce the same errors from the same causes. Test-driven development is a strategy for writing software that defines the functionality of the code through tests. If the system must perform in a certain way, a test is written that defines the behavior. Then code is written to pass that test. The primary difference between the two types of testing is that the former is performed after a bug is found, whereas the latter begins before code is written in hopes of catching potential errors. Cucumber is designed for the latter but works for both.
