We will be able to read data from the CSV and store it in a database.
	-student
	-courses
	-instructors
	-buildings and rooms

Will modify previous schema to include:
	-Instructors
	-times for course instances

Modify parser and csvs created to reflect new schema

write tests to check data for student/instructor schedules
